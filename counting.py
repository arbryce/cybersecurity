# Your task is very simple here: write a program that uses a for loop to "count mississippi" to five.
# Having counted to five, the program should print to the screen the final message "Ready or not, here I come!"

# Main

import time

for i in range (1, 6):
    time.sleep(1)
    print(i, 'Mississipi')

print ("Ready or not, here I come!")

# End
