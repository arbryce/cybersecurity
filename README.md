This repository contains all the coding skills and challenges learned through the Cybersecurity + Ops cohort with Savvy Coders.
The skills and challenges presented prepare students for possible real-world scenarios. 
Ops 201 focused on more in-depth scripting and automation with the use of flow control (loops, conditional statements, functions) and data (variables, command line arguments, arrays and strings).
My favorite Ops Challenge assignment was Ops Challenge 13 (DomainAnalyzer.sh) as it was the first script that I was able to complete with minimal assistance from the instructor. 
How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
